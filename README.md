# RaceTime

 App made to monitor the running time and the number of laps of people who play sports. I made the application for my own use, to monitor the time it takes to come and go to IFCE - Cear√° Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology and to monitor the time required to travel a certain distance using Reactjs and Nodejs.
